        <p>hi my name is cj.
        i love being a loser. i wouldnt ever change for the world.
        what is a loser? well, a loser listens to history podcasts to
        understand the problems that might repeat themselves later on.
        knowledge is the best weapon against brute force always. a loser
        doesn't care extensively about appearances. rather a loser focuses
        on their appearance retaining a sense of identity. its both cost effective
        and a form of alternative fashion. cut your bangs sloppily in the kitchen
        rather than paying for an $80 haircut that would somehow end up looking worse
        than what you butchered up in the sink. wear comfortable clothes that you can move 
        around in just in case you have to run out to buy supplies. supplies for what exactly? 
        supples for all the shit yr gonna be learning on the internet. the loser does not concern
        themself with whether or not what they are learning is valuable so long as it is a tactile skill
        that works to better the human condition be it through the simple joys of jewelrymaking
        or something more complicated such as coding a page of resources for those in need. the loser
        stays healthy and strong within reason, also. the loser cannot allow health to rule their entire world.
        a sense of community and continual learning is important for the loser to thrive.
